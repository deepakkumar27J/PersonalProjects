# Student Portal Microservices [Java, Node.js, NestJS, React]
    3 Microservices consisting of Student, Library and Financial implemented using Java for 2 services and 1 using Node.js(NestJS). The frontend was implemented using React. PostgreSQL was used to implement database for these services.
# Image Recognition on Cifar-10 [Python, Keras, Numpy]
     Recognized images from noisy cifar-10 data using ensemble of 3 deep neural networks and tree ensemble.
# Building and Analyzing a Data Warehouse for Metro Store in Islamabad [MySQL, Oracle db]
    Performed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) on metro data for rich analysis of business requirements.
# The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS)- Controller [Python]
    Built a simulator for the TORCS to compete with other players.
# Automated Library Management System [Java, JavaFX]
     E-Library Management System that provides a flexible, scalable and a robust system, to facilitate the management of the
     library, with the flexibility to support multiple client-side systems.
# Taxi Trip Duration Prediction [Python]
    Built an approximation theory-based model which predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City.
# The Network Emulator [C++]
     A network of routers was established to send one packet from source to destination using different data structures techniques.
 # Cache Simulation [C++]  
      In this project we implemented Level-1 cache and also simulated direct-mapped, set-associative and fully associative unified
       and split Level-1 caches.
